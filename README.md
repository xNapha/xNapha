My passion for technology started when I wanted to be the best pokemon trainer. 
Now it has evolved into a love for innovation and a curiosity of what is to come; a couple of reasons why I have been bewitched by the field. 
Because whenever I complete a project or a simple codewars challenge I am always left with this question in mind. 
“It works, but can it be better?”.  

Aside from fumbling around, I am usually:
 - reading and discover new book/manga series
 - walking my dog, watching netflix
 - brainstorming some fun short story ideas
 - learning how to draw. 

One of my goals is to create an animated short film, but with my current drawing skills, that’ll happen in a couple more centuries. 
Unless stick figures count, then maybe only a couple of decades.
